Summary of the SRL
==================

a) Research Question: "what features are needed in a tool in order to simulate security incidents in smart infrastructures?"
b) Search string:
( ("simulation" OR "co-simulation" OR "tools" OR "framework" OR "software") AND
  ("security"   OR "incident" OR "attack" OR "vulnerability") AND 
  ("smart"      OR "infrastructure" OR "cyber-physical system" OR "CPS") )
c) Interval: 10 years (since 2009)
d) Scientific libraries (computing): 
   1) Google Scholar - https://scholar.google.com/
   2) ACM Portal     - http://portal.acm.org/
   3) IEEExplore     - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/
   4) Scopus         - https://www.scopus.com/
e) Inclusion criteria:
   - must use simulation
   - must be directed towards security
   - must have an application or case study in smart infrastructures
   - use of both power and network communications
f) Exclusion criteria:
   - low level domain application (e.g. work on PMU or smart meters details)
   - not used the underlying communication network or integrated with the power simulator
   - theoretical frameworks (without valid implementation) or frameworks 
     not validated or thoroughly tested
g) Data extraction and reporting:
   1) tool details, versions, programming language, license
   2) offered features for modelling and simulating
   3) work objective
   4) description of the incident or attack that was modelled
   5) details and particularities about the smart infrastructure
   6) modelling features, e.g. simplicity, topology creation (for power and network)
   7) scalability possibilities
   8) abstractions and models of smart infrastructure components
